# Customer Segmentation Project
A Customer Segmentation Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Method

An e-commerce business wanted to initiate email marketing campaign. In order to do so, it was decided that this campaign would be more effective if we send persalized marketing email. So, we decided to do a comprehensive customer segmentation to identify the behavior of each segment and send them marketing emails that suits their needs. In this way we can encourage them to visit our website and buy from us.

The tools used in this project are as follows:

* SQL using GCP BigQuery
* Microsoft Power BI
